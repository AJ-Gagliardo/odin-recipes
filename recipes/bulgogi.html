        Description
            </h2>
            <p>The meat, while tender, still had a little bit of chewiness to it. You can control texture by the thickness or thinness of the slices and how long you marinate them. But this Korean-style BBQ recipe has a fairly fast-acting marinade, so I go with an hour or two.

            <h3> Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 ¼ pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
        
                <li>4 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
        
                <li>¼ cup grated yellow onion</li>
        
                <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot</li>
        
                <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        
                <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        
                <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Asian pear</li>
        
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        
                <li>1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        
                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing skillet</li>
        
                <li>2 cups hot steamed rice, or as needed</li>
        
                <li>2 sliced green onion tops for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.
                </li>
                <li>
                Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.
                </li>
        
            </ol>
